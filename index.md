# What is it? Who are we?

Basically, we want to have a hackergarten in Lausanne, like they have had in
the Swiss German region and in Germany for a while.

Let me take the description of the
[Hackergarten.net](http://hackergarten.net/) website:

> Hackergarten is a craftmen's workshop, classroom, a laboratory, a social
> circle, a writing group, a playground, and an artist's studio. Our goal is to
> create something that others can use; whether it be working software, improved
> documentation, or better educational materials. Our intent is to end each
> meeting with a patch or similar contribution submitted to an open and public
> project. Membership is open to anyone willing to contribute their time.

# Why?

* _Because_ there are many meetups where you can go and hear somebody talk and
  maybe learn something, but there are few where you **DO** something
* _Because_ working on a project from home is hard (the husband/wife, the
  kids, the dog, the laundry, the dinner... are all fighting for your attention)
* _Because_ working alongside other like-minded people is very motivational
* _Because_ having others around, with different knowledge/experience, can help
  you deal with some problems you have
* _Because_ you might find someone that want to work on your project, thus
  allowing you to deliver more things
* _Because_ you are likely to learn some new things in the contact of others
* _Because_ hopefully it's going to be a fun night

# When and where do we meet?

We try to meet once a month. Check our [Meetup]() page for more information.

# How does it work in practice?

Some people come with an open source project, or an idea for a contribution.
They come to work on it, and even better, find other people that would like to
help them work on it.

Other people come to help, or to look for inspiration.

They are all willing to contribute. Some already know on what project, topics,
others are looking, but they'll soon find a project to work on!

Everyone chooses something to do and help for as much and as long as they want.
People with the projects or the ideas help organize the work if some others
want to help them.

Before leaving, it is encouraged that everyone says a word on what they did.
This can be anything: some code, some documentation, some neatly documented
bug report, ...
